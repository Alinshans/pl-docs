This is a formal repository about some programing languages and something about their theory.

## Rules

English wording of this repository is intended to be conforming to [the ISO/IEC directive, part 3](http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg9/isodir3.pdf). Note the use of modal verbs is distinct with [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Text File

All text files should be encoded as UTF-8 with [BOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) enabled.

Newlines shall be consistent. Default use of newline is [CR+LF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF).

Two subsequent newlines indicates an [EOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file) logically. Subsequent newlines should only be used at EOF.

Except at the first of line, each word which consists of [alphanumeric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric) characters should be seperated by a single space character(U+0020) with other words.

No [space characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_characters#Spaces_in_Unicode) should be at [EOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-line).

To keep the semantics rules clear, use \<TAB\> rather than \<SPACE\>s to indent, unless the text is verbatim quoted.

### [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Names of markdown files should be with .md extension.

Unless explicitly specified elsewhere, only common dialects are to be used. Currently this should be [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

Note: Use \<TAB\> instead of \<SPACE\>s to indent in markdown for list items to avoid some compatibility issues, e.g. [this](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/7748/markdown-nested-lists-not-working-bb-8925).
